## My writing style

Try to make this a atrractive blog discussion this, use plain and oral english. 
Try to come up with some nice titles. 
Do not use complex words, do not use too much lists, keep the paragraph and sentence short, clear but the content should be as detail as possible and it should content all we discuessed. 
Make it as detail as possible.
